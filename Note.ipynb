       " 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.',\n",
       " 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\\nwell.',\n",

       " 'She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.',\n",
       " 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.',\n",
       " \"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas!\",\n",
       " 'either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them.',\n",
